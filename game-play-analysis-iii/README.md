<pre>+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |

(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played&nbsp;<strong>so far</strong>&nbsp;by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example:</p>

<pre>Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 1         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| player_id | event_date | games_played_so_far |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01 | 5                   |
| 1         | 2016-05-02 | 11                  |
| 1         | 2017-06-25 | 12                  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02 | 0                   |
| 3         | 2018-07-03 | 5                   |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.
